# D4D-SpaceOperationsRoadmap
Design for Defense project at CU Boulder - Spring 2020 - Space Operations Roadmap

This repository is for collaboration on documents, source code and any products developed during the D4D Spring Semester 2020 project at CU Boulder on developing a roadmap for space operations over the next 40 years.

The roadmap uses estimates of future space launches, satellite populations, orbital debris and manned space flight to define the requirements for systems that will manage these operations in a safe, secure and effective manner.

The goal of the roadmap is to examine what near term research and development is approporiate for meeting the long term requirements, compare those near term research needs with existing research and propose efforts to eliminate the gaps.
